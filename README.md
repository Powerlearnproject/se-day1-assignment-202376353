#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a discipline within computer science that focuses on software development, testing and maintenance.
It plays an important role in the technology industry by ensuring that software functions properly, maintains a high standard, handles increased workload without compromising productivity, and is secure. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity: 
Mastering Process:
Mastering Machine:


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

planning- I identify project requirements, define objectives, and estimate resources and costs
requirement analysis- is useful when gathering and analysing user and business requirements to ensure the project meets expectations.

design- creating system architecture, database structures, and user interfaces based on requirements.
coding- writing and developing the actual software using programming languages.
testing- evaluating the software for bugs, errors and security vulnerabilities before deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: takes an approach which is more sequential and follows a step-by-step process, 
          : It is more difficult to make changes once the process has been started
          : clients are less involved after the initial requirements
          : The testing phase occurs after the development is complete and is good for large projects with well-defined requirements
Scenario: Developing software for a banking system where security and regulatory compliance are critical. The requirements are well-defined, and changes can be costly later.

Agile: Iterative, flexible, and adaptive
     : Allows continuous changes
     : changes are based on feedback 
     : clients have Continuous involvement throughout the development
     : Testing is ongoing throughout the process
Scenario: Developing a mobile app that requires frequent updates based on user feedback. Agile allows for continuous improvements and quick adaptations to changing user needs

Roles and Responsibilities in a Software Engineering Team
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: They build the software—writing code, testing it, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. 
 Key responsibilities: Writing clean and efficient code.  Debugging and fixing issues. Collaborating with the team to develop new features. Staying up to date with the latest programming trends and tools. 
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Their job is to ensure the software works properly before reaching users. They test it, find bugs, and ensure it meets quality standards. 
Project Manager: They oversee the entire software development process, ensuring everything is on track, deadlines are met, and team members are aligned.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

What they are: These are software tools that provide a workspace for coding, testing, and debugging all in one place. 
 Why they’re important: 
They make coding easier with features like auto-completion and error highlighting. 
They streamline the development process by integrating multiple tools. 
  Examples: 
VS Code -A lightweight, versatile code editor.
IntelliJ IDEA – Great for Java development. 
PyCharm– Designed for Python programmers. 
Version Control Systems (VCS) 
What they are: Tools that help developers track changes in code over time, making collaboration easier. 
Why they’re important: 
Allow developers to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. Enable multiple people to work on the same project without conflicts. 
Examples:
Git– The most popular VCS, often used with platforms like GitHub. 
SVN (Subversion) – Used in enterprise environments.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping Up with New Technologies

The challenge: Tech evolves fast, and new programming languages, frameworks, and tools appear all the time. 
How to handle it: Stay curious, read tech blogs, take online courses, and practice new skills with personal projects. 

Debugging and Fixing Bugs
The challenge: Finding and fixing errors can be frustrating and time-consuming. 
How to handle it: Use debugging tools, write unit tests, and approach problems systematically rather than randomly trying fixes. 

Meeting Deadlines and Managing Workload
The challenge: Software projects often have tight deadlines, and multiple tasks can be overwhelming. 
How to handle it:  Break tasks into smaller steps, prioritise efficiently, and use project management tools like Jira or Trello. 

 

Team Collaboration

 The challenge: Miscommunication between team members can lead to misunderstandings and project delays. 

   How to handle it: Use collaboration tools like Slack, have regular team check-ins, and document key project decisions. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing
What it is: Testing small, individual code pieces to ensure they work correctly. 
Why it’s important: It helps catch bugs early before they become bigger problems. 

Integration Testing 
What it is: Check if different software parts work together as expected. 
Why it’s important to ensure that modules communicate properly and prevent system failures. 
 
System Testing 
What it is: Testing the entire system to ensure it functions. 
Why it’s important: Confirms that the software meets technical and functional requirements. 

Acceptance Testing 
What it is: Testing if the software meets user and business requirements before release. 
Why it’s important: It ensures the final product is ready for real-world use. 

 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting clear and specific instructions to get the best responses from AI models. It’s all about asking the right questions in the right way to improve the accuracy and usefulness of AI-generated answers.
Good prompt engineering makes AI more effective in several ways:  It gets better answers, well structured prompt helps the AI give more relevant and useful responses. 
It avoids confusion; clear prompts prevent misunderstandings and off-topic answers. It saves time. The clearer your prompt, the fewer follow-up questions you’ll need.  Makes AI more useful. With the right prompts, AI can help with everything from research to creative writing and problem-solving


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about history.
Improved Prompt: Give me a brief summary of World War II, including its causes, key events, and outcomes.
More specifically, Instead of asking about all of history, it focuses on World War II.  Clearer expectations, It tells the AI exactly what to include: causes, key events, and outcomes. More helpful answer: The response will be focused and informative rather than overly broad.
